# Insert Records

The "insert records" content element allows to reference other records from other pages and languages.

When the referenced content element lives on another page, that page must exist on foreign. If it is missing, the
referenced content element will not be rendered.

You can not publish the "insert records" content element until all pages of all referenced content elements do exist on
foreign and their enabled/disabled state equals the state on local. Otherwise, the rendered result will be different.
